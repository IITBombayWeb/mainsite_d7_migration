    # First we convert the multiple tag values into an array of tag names
    # using the explode plugin which simply explodes/splits a string by a given
    # delimiter. In our case, we split the text by ", " to get rid of the
    # spaces after the commas at once.

    # Once the tag names are converted to arrays, we pass the term names
    # through the "migration" plugin. This easy-to-use plugin does the grand
    # task of looking up the terms we imported during the "term_tags"
    # migration and utilizes the IDs of those terms during this migration.
    #
    # To make things better, it can handle multiple values, so each term
    # name gets converted into it's relevant ID. Cool!
    #
    # The migration plugin can be used when the related entities (like tags)
    # are available in a separate data source so that they can be imported
    # first. If they are not available or cannot be extracted to their own
    # data source for the migration, one would have to write their own
    # "process" plugin to explode the terms and translate the term names into
    # their corresponding term IDs.
